.. I decided to take a course in open source software because it would be beneficial for me in **more** ways than one. When I found out that my college offers this class, I knew that **I had to take it**. I am very excited to learn about how to make contributions and find out how open source software works. This will **definetely** help me in the future and at the same time fulfill the requirments for my major.
