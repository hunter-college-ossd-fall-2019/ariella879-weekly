## My Experience in Open Source 

The course met my expectations. I was expecting to learn about
how I can contribute to open source and I learned just that along with
some important linux commands and how to use the terminal to contribute
more quickly. I am overall very happy that I took this course because I learned 
a lot and now feel more confident to embark on this journey of contributing
to open source software. I did not expect to need to use the terminal in 
order to make a contribution, but I thought it was very interesting how
you can do so much from just using the command line. 
 I would change what I initially thought that the contributions that I can make can 
only be document related. Now I know I can do more such as contributing how to use a method
in an algorithm. Furthermore, the projects that interest me now are projects 
that help people learning coding and algorithms because in this way I can help others 
as well as refresh my memory of what I learned or even learn something new!
